Role Prompt Certification Checklist

The Combine — Certified Role Prompts

This checklist defines the minimum requirements for a role prompt to be considered certified and eligible for:

versioning

replay

mechanical evaluation

use in governed execution paths

Any failure blocks certification.

1. Structural Integrity (Required)
1.1 Role Identity Defined

 Role identity is clearly stated in the opening section

 Identity applies across all tasks (not scenario-specific)

 Role purpose is expressed as responsibility, not activity

❌ Fail if: the role sounds like a job description tied to a specific artifact or phase.

1.2 Explicit Authority Boundaries

 Clear statement of what the role may decide

 Clear statement of what the role may not decide

 Conflict-handling posture is explicit (surface vs resolve)

❌ Fail if: the role implicitly resolves conflicts outside its authority.

2. Separation of Concerns (Hard Stop)
2.1 No Task Logic

 No instructions for what to produce

 No schemas, formats, or deliverables

 No references to specific artifacts (e.g., “epic doc”, “PRD”, “API spec”)

❌ Fail if: any output expectations appear.

2.2 No Workflow or Ceremony

 No step sequences

 No process invention

 No references to meetings, rituals, or cadence

❌ Fail if: the role defines how work flows rather than how it reasons.

3. Subordinate Persona Discipline (Mandatory)
3.1 Exactly Three Subordinate Personae

 Exactly three are defined (no more, no fewer)

❌ Fail if: count ≠ 3.

3.2 Each Subordinate Has:

For each subordinate:

 Clear purpose (what it is good at)

 Explicit failure mode (what it overdoes or misses)

 Defined as an internal reasoning lens only

❌ Fail if: a subordinate appears to act independently or produce output.

3.3 Consultation Rules

 Subordinates are consulted silently by default

 Externalization requires explicit instruction

❌ Fail if: subordinates speak or act unless requested.

4. Governance Alignment (ADR Compliance)
4.1 ADR-009 (Audit & Governance)

 Role treats state, decisions, and transitions as explicit

 No silent mutation or assumption correction

4.2 ADR-010 (LLM Execution Logging)

 Execution context and recorded artifacts are treated as authoritative

 No reliance on memory, intuition, or inferred state

❌ Fail if: the role compensates for missing context.

5. Behavioral Constraints (Tone & Discipline)
5.1 No Vibe or Motivation Language

 No inspirational framing

 No coaching tone

 No anthropomorphic encouragement

❌ Fail if: the prompt attempts to “energize” or “guide” emotionally.

5.2 No UI / Implementation Leakage

 No UI layout, routing, or UX guidance

 No technical implementation details

❌ Fail if: the role crosses into solution design or presentation.

6. Prompt Governance Boilerplate (Required)
6.1 Triggering Instruction Present (Verbatim)

 Includes the following text unchanged:

Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This role prompt defines identity, authority, and internal reasoning boundaries.
Do not introduce task-specific behavior unless explicitly provided in a task prompt.


❌ Fail if: missing, altered, or paraphrased.

7. Stability & Replay Readiness
7.1 Task Independence

 Prompt can be replayed in isolation

 No hidden assumptions about current task or phase

7.2 Drift Risk Declared

 Explicit statement of primary drift risks

 Risks are role-specific, not generic

❌ Fail if: drift risk is omitted or vague.

8. Certification Outcome

✅ Certified — All checks pass

⚠️ Needs Revision — Any single check fails

❌ Rejected — Structural or separation violations

Enforcement Rule

A role prompt that fails certification must not be used in governed execution paths.

No exceptions. No “just this once.”
