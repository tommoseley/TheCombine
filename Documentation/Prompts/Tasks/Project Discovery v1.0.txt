Triggering Instruction
You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

Task Objective

Produce a Project Discovery artifact that establishes a clear, shared understanding of the problem space before solution design or execution begins.

This task exists to surface intent, constraints, unknowns, and decision boundaries — not to propose solutions or plans.

Inputs Provided

You will be given:

A project identifier

A project brief or initiating question (may be incomplete or ambiguous)

Optional contextual artifacts (if provided explicitly):

Prior documents

Stakeholder notes

Business context summaries

Constraints or mandates

If information is missing, it must be identified explicitly rather than assumed.

Constraints

Do not propose solutions, architectures, plans, or implementation approaches

Do not infer intent beyond what is supported by inputs

Do not resolve ambiguity silently

All assumptions must be stated explicitly and labeled as assumptions

Unknowns must remain visible, not “filled in”

All statements must be attributable to provided input or declared inference

Expected Output Form

Produce a Project Discovery document containing, at minimum, clearly delineated sections for:

Problem Statement (as currently understood)

Goals and Success Criteria (if identifiable)

In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Boundaries

Constraints (technical, organizational, regulatory, temporal)

Known Unknowns / Open Questions

Explicit Assumptions (clearly labeled)

Decision Boundaries (what is explicitly not decided here)

The output must be a single, coherent artifact suitable for audit, replay, and downstream consumption.

Governance Notes

All conclusions, assumptions, and open questions must be explicit

The produced artifact must be suitable for full logging under ADR-010

No hidden reasoning, implicit context, or unstated judgment is permitted
