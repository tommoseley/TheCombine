Here is the Task Prompt Certification Checklist — intentionally parallel in tone, rigor, and enforceability to your Role Prompt Certification model.

This is written to be mechanically checkable, not advisory.

Task Prompt Certification Checklist

The Combine — Certified Task Prompts

A task prompt must pass every section to be certified.

1. Prompt Classification (Gate 0)

☐ Prompt is explicitly a TASK prompt, not a role prompt
☐ Prompt assumes an existing certified role prompt
☐ Prompt does not redefine identity, authority, or values

❌ Fail if role-level content appears.

2. Triggering Instruction (Mandatory)

☐ Prompt includes the following instruction verbatim:

Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.


❌ Fail if missing or altered.

3. Task Scope Definition (Required)

☐ The task prompt clearly defines what is to be produced now
☐ The task prompt lists all inputs explicitly
☐ The task prompt states constraints (time, completeness, fidelity, etc.)
☐ The task prompt defines expected output form, if applicable

⚠️ Risk if scope boundaries are implied rather than stated.

4. Separation of Concerns (Hard Boundary)

☐ No role identity language
☐ No subordinate personae definitions
☐ No authority expansion or contraction
☐ No cross-task coordination logic

❌ Fail if task prompt alters role posture.

5. Determinism & Replay Readiness

☐ Prompt is deterministic given identical inputs
☐ Prompt does not rely on hidden state or prior runs
☐ Prompt is replayable without human interpretation
☐ Any unavoidable ambiguity is explicitly acknowledged

⚠️ Risk if output variance cannot be explained.

6. Input Integrity & Explicitness

☐ All required context is provided as input
☐ No assumptions about “known” facts
☐ No reliance on conversational memory
☐ External references are named and bounded

❌ Fail if the task relies on implicit knowledge.

7. Governance Compliance
ADR-009 — Audit & Governance

☐ Decisions must be explicit
☐ No silent correction or interpretation
☐ No inferred intent substitution

ADR-010 — LLM Execution Logging

☐ All inputs are loggable
☐ Outputs are capturable artifacts
☐ No instruction to bypass logging, QA, or traceability

❌ Fail if governance is bypassed or weakened.

8. Prohibited Content Scan

☐ No UI styling or presentation guidance
☐ No routing or infrastructure detail
☐ No workflow invention
☐ No motivational, coaching, or “vibe” language
☐ No optimization for speed at the cost of traceability

❌ Fail on any violation.

9. Output Discipline

☐ Output requirements are explicit or intentionally open
☐ No implied secondary outputs
☐ No cross-task side effects

⚠️ Risk if output expectations are ambiguous.

10. Stability & Certification Readiness

☐ Prompt is stable enough to be versioned
☐ Prompt is suitable for replay comparison
☐ Prompt can be evaluated by mechanical QA
☐ Drift risks are explicitly noted

Certification Verdict

A task prompt is:

✅ Certified — passes all checks

⚠️ Provisionally Acceptable — minor risks, no violations

❌ Rejected — any hard-boundary failure

Common Failure Patterns (for Auditors)

Task prompt quietly redefining role behavior

“Just this once” exceptions

Missing Triggering Instruction

Assuming context instead of declaring it

Overhelpful prompts that leak workflow logic
