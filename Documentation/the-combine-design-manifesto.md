# The Combine: Design Manifesto

## Purpose
The Combine is a workbench for structured project work, not a conversational interface. The design must support hours of focused use without visual fatigue or cognitive friction.

## Core Principle: Calm Authority
When users open The Combine, their shoulders should drop. The interface communicates competence through restraint, not excitement through novelty.

## Visual Language

### Color as Information
Use a muted palette: off-white backgrounds (#F8F9FA), charcoal text (#1F2937), restrained blue for primary actions (#2563EB). Status colors (green/amber/red) convey meaning, never decoration.

### Typography for Endurance
Inter or system fonts at 15px minimum for body text. Clear hierarchy through weight and size, not shouting. If users squint by 3pm, we've failed.

### Breathing Room is Non-Negotiable
Generous spacing between sections (32px minimum), within panels (24px padding), and in line height (1.6). Dense information requires space to be legible.

## Interaction Design

### Boring Buttons Are Good Buttons
Primary actions use clear verbs: Generate, Review, Approve, Advance. No conversational tone, no personality. Button labels answer "what happens when I click this?" and what it will cost or change.

### Consistency Builds Trust
The same action always appears in the same place. The same colors always mean the same thing. The same layout structure across all artifacts. Predictability is the feature.

### Minimal Motion
Subtle fades and expands only. No bouncing, no sliding panels, no attention-grabbing animations. Motion communicates state change, never personality.

## Layout Philosophy

### Spatial Over Temporal
Three-pane structure: left navigation (project hierarchy), center workspace (current artifact), right activity (mentor status and history). Users must always know where they are and what they're viewing.

### Progressive Disclosure
Show what's needed now. Hide what's not. Collapsible sections, contextual panels, and clear state indicators prevent overwhelming users with everything at once, while making system state always visible.

## Defaults, Not Options
The Combine favors strong defaults over configurability. Customization is added only when it demonstrably improves clarity or reduces friction. Flexibility that undermines consistency is a bug, not a feature.

## The Disappearing Tool
If users notice the interface more than their work, we've designed badly. The highest compliment: "I forgot I was using software."

## What We Never Do
No gradients. No AI personality avatars. No marketing language in the interface. No thin fonts or pure white backgrounds. No surprises in interaction patterns. No clever animations.

## Success Metrics
Can a director scan a screen and understand project status in 3 seconds? Can a PM work for 4 hours without eye strain? Does the tool feel like serious software, not a demo? If yes to all three, the design succeeds.
