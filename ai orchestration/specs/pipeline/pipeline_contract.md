The pipeline stages must proceed in order:

1. PM Charter
2. PM Epic
3. Architecture
4. Backlog

Each stage requires:
- Domain Orchestrator output
- Schema validation
- User approval

No stage may run before the previous is approved.
No stage may run from raw user input.
All stages run only from canonical documents.
