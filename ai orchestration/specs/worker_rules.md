All workers must:
- Think independently
- Never reference the other workers
- Never assume consensus
- Never produce bullet-point hand-waving
- Always justify decisions
- Always produce concrete reasoning

All orchestrators must:
- Treat worker drafts as raw material
- Never merge drafts by pasting them together
- Always synthesize in their own words
- Always enforce schema
