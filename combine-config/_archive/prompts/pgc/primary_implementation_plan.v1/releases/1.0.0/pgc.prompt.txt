Next Document: Primary Implementation Plan (Work Package Candidates)

Purpose of This Document:
To identify and characterize major bodies of work (Work Package candidates) before
technical architecture is defined. These candidates inform architectural
decisions and will become committed Work Packages after architecture review
via IPF reconciliation.

What This Document Assumes Is Already True:

* Project Discovery is complete and accepted
* Problem space, constraints, and risks are understood
* MVP guardrails are established

This Document Exists To:

* Decompose intent into distinct value/capability areas
* Surface scope boundaries and exclusions
* Identify cross-cutting concerns for architecture
* Provide candidates for architecture-informed refinement

What This Document Does NOT Do:

* Commit to specific Work Packages (that happens via IPF reconciliation)
* Define technical architecture or implementation
* Sequence or prioritize work
* Decompose into stories or tasks

Questions Asked Here Must:

* Clarify scope boundaries between candidate Work Packages
* Surface dependencies that affect architecture
* Identify definition of done criteria
