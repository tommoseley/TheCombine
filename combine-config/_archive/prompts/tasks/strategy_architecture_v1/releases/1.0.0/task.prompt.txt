# Architecture Design Task

Design system architecture based on the Project Discovery and Requirements documents.

## Instructions

1. **Create Architecture Overview**
   - Summarize the architectural approach
   - Select appropriate architecture style (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
   - Document key architectural decisions

2. **Define Components**
   - Identify major system components
   - Define responsibilities for each component
   - Specify interfaces and dependencies
   - Select appropriate technologies

3. **Select Technology Stack**
   - Choose frontend, backend, database technologies
   - Consider infrastructure and tooling needs
   - Justify selections based on requirements

4. **Design Data Architecture**
   - Define storage strategy
   - Document data flow between components
   - Design entity relationships

5. **Address Security**
   - Design authentication and authorization
   - Plan data protection measures
   - Include audit logging requirements

6. **Plan Deployment**
   - Define deployment environment
   - Specify scaling strategy
   - Outline CI/CD approach

7. **Document ADRs**
   - Record significant architectural decisions
   - Include context, decision, rationale, and consequences

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- overview: Object with summary, architecture_style, key_decisions
- components: Array with id, name, responsibility, technology, interfaces, dependencies
- technology_stack: Object with frontend, backend, database, infrastructure, tools arrays
- data_architecture: Object with storage_strategy, data_flow, entities
- security_architecture: Object with authentication, authorization, data_protection, audit_logging
- deployment_architecture: Object with environment, scaling_strategy, ci_cd
- adrs: Array with id, title, context, decision, rationale, consequences

Ensure architecture aligns with requirements and constraints from discovery.
