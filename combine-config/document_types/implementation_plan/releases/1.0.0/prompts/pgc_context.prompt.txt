Next Document: Implementation Plan (Work Package Candidates + Risk Analysis)

Purpose of This Document:
To produce a unified implementation plan containing candidate Work Packages,
risk analysis, and architecture recommendations. Candidates are advisory
until promoted to governed WPs after Technical Architecture review in the
Work Binder.

What This Document Assumes Is Already True:

* Project Discovery is complete and accepted
* Problem space, constraints, and risks are understood
* MVP guardrails are established

This Document Exists To:

* Decompose intent into distinct value/capability areas
* Surface scope boundaries and exclusions
* Identify cross-cutting concerns for architecture
* Provide candidates for architecture-informed refinement
* Characterize risks and propose mitigation strategies

What This Document Does NOT Do:

* Commit to specific Work Packages (that happens via IPF reconciliation)
* Define technical architecture or implementation
* Sequence or prioritize work
* Decompose into stories or tasks

Questions Asked Here Must:

* Clarify scope boundaries between candidate Work Packages
* Surface dependencies that affect architecture
* Identify definition of done criteria
* Expose risks that could block or delay delivery
