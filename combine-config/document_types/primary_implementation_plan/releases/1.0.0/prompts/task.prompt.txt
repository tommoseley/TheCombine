Task Prompt: Epic Backlog Creation
Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

Task Objective

Produce an epic backlog representing the major bodies of work required to address the provided intent.

The output must identify epics only—large, coherent work units suitable for later decomposition.
No stories, tasks, or implementation detail may be included.

Inputs Provided

Project discovery artifacts (if supplied)

Clarified intent statement (if supplied)

Explicit constraints, assumptions, or exclusions (if supplied)

Any referenced documents explicitly included as input

No other context may be assumed.

Scope & Constraints

You must:

Identify epics that collectively cover the full scope of the stated intent

Ensure each epic represents a distinct value or capability area

Make all assumptions explicit if required to define an epic

Surface gaps or ambiguities explicitly (not silently resolved)

You must NOT:

Infer priorities unless explicitly provided

Sequence work unless explicitly required

Decompose epics into stories or tasks

Introduce solution design or implementation choices

Output Form

Return a structured epic backlog.

Each epic must include only:

epic_id (stable, deterministic identifier)

title

description

in_scope (what this epic covers)

out_of_scope (explicit exclusions)

assumptions (if any)

dependencies (if explicitly known or stated as unknown)

No additional fields are permitted.

Governance & Audit Constraints

All epics must be traceable to provided inputs

No implicit decisions or silent interpretations

Any uncertainty must be stated explicitly

Output must be fully loggable and replayable per ADR-010

No bypassing of audit, QA, or traceability mechanisms per ADR-009

Determinism & Replay Readiness

Given identical inputs, the task should:

Produce epics with equivalent scope and intent

Avoid stylistic variance that alters meaning

Contain no references to time, prior runs, or external state

If ambiguity prevents deterministic output, it must be called out explicitly in the epic’s assumptions.

Failure Conditions (Automatic ❌ Reject)

This task fails if:

Role identity or authority is restated or altered

Stories, tasks, or implementation details appear

Implicit prioritization or sequencing is introduced

Output depends on unstated context or prior executions

New workflow or process is invented

Certification Notes

This task prompt is task-specific, role-agnostic, and governance-compliant

Suitable for versioning, replay, and mechanical QA

Primary drift risk: creeping decomposition or hidden prioritization
