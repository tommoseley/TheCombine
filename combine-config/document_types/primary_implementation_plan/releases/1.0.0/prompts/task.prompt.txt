Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

Task Objective

Produce a Primary Implementation Plan that translates discovery and architectural understanding into an executable planning structure.

The output must define notional epics and their logical sequencing, sufficient to guide downstream refinement without implying commitment, estimation, or execution readiness.

This task exists to establish structure, scope boundaries, dependencies, and decision gates — not to create a delivery backlog.

Inputs Provided

You may be given one or more of the following (only if explicitly supplied):

* Project Discovery artifact
* Technical Architecture artifact (if available)
* Clarified intent statement
* Explicit constraints, assumptions, exclusions, or mandates
* Referenced documents explicitly included as input
* No other context may be assumed.

Scope & Constraints

You MUST:
* Identify notional epics that collectively cover the intended scope
* Ensure each epic represents a distinct body of work or capability
* Define logical dependencies between epics where necessary
* Identify decision gates or prerequisite validations that affect progression
* Surface unknowns, risks, or ambiguities explicitly
* Make all assumptions explicit when required to define scope

You MUST NOT:

* Decompose epics into features, stories, tasks, or implementation detail
* Assign estimates, timelines, priorities, or ownership
* Imply delivery commitment or execution readiness
* Introduce solution design beyond what is already stated in inputs
* Invent process, workflow, or governance structures not provided
* Output Form
* Return a structured Primary Implementation Plan.

The plan must include:

1. Plan Overview
* intent_summary (plain-language restatement of purpose)
* planning_assumptions (explicit assumptions made during planning)
* known_unknowns (gaps that block downstream certainty)

2. Notional Epics

Each epic must include only:
* epic_id (stable, deterministic identifier)
* title
* description
* in_scope
* out_of_scope
* assumptions (if any)
* dependencies
* explicit dependencies (if known)
* or "unknown" if unresolved
* decision_gates
* conditions that must be satisfied before refinement or execution
* No additional fields are permitted.

Governance & Audit Constraints

* All epics must be traceable to provided inputs
* No implicit decisions or silent interpretations
* Any uncertainty must be explicitly stated
* Output must be fully loggable and replayable per ADR-010
* No bypassing of audit, QA, or traceability mechanisms per ADR-009

Determinism & Replay Readiness

Given identical inputs, the task should:
* Produce equivalent epics with equivalent scope and intent
* Preserve semantic meaning across runs
* Avoid stylistic variance that alters interpretation
* Contain no references to time, prior executions, or external state

If ambiguity prevents deterministic output, it must be explicitly recorded in:

* planning_assumptions
* or the epic’s assumptions / decision_gates

Failure Conditions (Automatic ❌ Reject)

This task fails if:
* Role identity or authority is restated or altered
* Stories, tasks, features, or implementation detail appear
* Prioritization, estimation, or scheduling is introduced
* Output depends on unstated context or prior runs
* Execution workflow or delivery process is invented
* Commitment is implied

Certification Notes

This task prompt is task-specific, role-agnostic, and governance-compliant
* Produces planning artifacts, not delivery commitments
* Suitable for versioning, replay, and mechanical QA
* Primary drift risks:
  * creeping decomposition
  * hidden prioritization
  * accidental backlog creation
