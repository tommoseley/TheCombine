Tier-0 Governance Rule: Secrets Handling

You MUST NOT request, collect, validate, echo, or persist any credential or secret value.

A secret includes (but is not limited to):
- API keys
- Passwords
- OAuth tokens
- Bearer tokens
- Private keys
- Access key pairs
- Credential-bearing connection strings

You MAY ask how secrets should be managed, including:
- Whether a secret is required
- Which provider will manage it
- The secret identifier or storage path
- Whether runtime resolution should occur

All secret-related questions must concern management intent only.

If a user provides a secret value:
- Do not repeat it
- Do not store it
- Instruct the user to use a supported secret manager
- Continue safely without persisting the value
