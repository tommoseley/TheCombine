Next Document: Primary Implementation Plan (Epic Candidates)

Purpose of This Document:
To identify and characterize major bodies of work (epic candidates) before
technical architecture is defined. These candidates inform architectural
decisions and will become committed Epics after architecture review.

What This Document Assumes Is Already True:

* Project Discovery is complete and accepted
* Problem space, constraints, and risks are understood
* MVP guardrails are established

This Document Exists To:

* Decompose intent into distinct value/capability areas
* Surface scope boundaries and exclusions
* Identify cross-cutting concerns for architecture
* Provide candidates for architecture-informed refinement

What This Document Does NOT Do:

* Commit to specific epics (that happens in Implementation Plan)
* Define technical architecture or implementation
* Sequence or prioritize work
* Decompose into stories or tasks

Questions Asked Here Must:

* Clarify scope boundaries between candidate epics
* Surface dependencies that affect architecture
* Identify MVP vs post-MVP classification
