# PGC Context: Technical Architecture

## Purpose

This Pre-Generation Clarification context guides question generation before producing a Technical Architecture document. The goal is to surface architectural unknowns that, if left implicit, would force speculative design decisions.

## Clarification Domains

### 1. Hosting & Infrastructure Constraints

Unknowns that affect where and how the system runs:
- Cloud provider requirements or restrictions (AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem)
- Containerization requirements (Kubernetes, ECS, bare metal)
- Region/locality constraints (data residency, latency requirements)
- Existing infrastructure that must be integrated or avoided

### 2. Technology Stack Constraints

Unknowns that affect implementation choices:
- Mandated languages, frameworks, or platforms
- Prohibited technologies (licensing, policy, skill gaps)
- Existing systems that dictate protocol or format choices
- Build/deployment toolchain requirements

### 3. Integration Boundaries

Unknowns about external system interactions:
- Required integrations with existing systems
- API contracts or protocols that must be honored
- Data format requirements from upstream/downstream systems
- Authentication/authorization integration points

### 4. Security & Compliance Requirements

Unknowns that constrain architectural options:
- Regulatory frameworks (HIPAA, SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
- Data classification requirements
- Encryption requirements (at rest, in transit)
- Audit logging and retention requirements
- Network segmentation requirements

### 5. Non-Functional Requirement Priorities

Unknowns about quality attribute tradeoffs:
- Performance targets (latency, throughput)
- Availability requirements (uptime SLA)
- Scalability expectations (concurrent users, data volume)
- Recovery requirements (RPO, RTO)
- Cost constraints that limit architectural options

### 6. Operational Constraints

Unknowns that affect how the system is operated:
- Team skill sets and learning curve tolerance
- Existing monitoring/observability infrastructure
- Deployment frequency expectations
- Support model (on-call, managed service)

## Question Generation Guidelines

1. **Ask only what blocks architecture decisions** - Don't ask about implementation details that can be deferred
2. **Prefer bounded choices over open-ended questions** - "AWS, Azure, or on-prem?" not "What cloud do you want?"
3. **Surface constraints, not preferences** - Focus on what MUST be true, not what would be nice
4. **Reference upstream documents** - Use Project Discovery and Primary Implementation Plan as context
5. **Flag assumptions explicitly** - If proceeding without an answer, state the assumption clearly

## Input Context

The following documents should inform question generation:
- **Project Discovery**: Problem space, stakeholders, high-level constraints
- **Primary Implementation Plan**: Scope, epics, sequencing, MVP boundaries

Questions should NOT re-ask what these documents already answer. Focus on architectural gaps.
