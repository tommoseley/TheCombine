# Quality Review Task

Review all strategy documents for completeness, consistency, and quality.

## Instructions

1. **Assess Overall Quality**
   - Determine overall status (approved, approved_with_conditions, needs_revision, rejected)
   - Calculate confidence score (0-100)
   - Summarize the review findings

2. **Identify Findings**
   - Check each document for issues
   - Categorize by severity (critical, major, minor, observation)
   - Categorize by type (completeness, consistency, feasibility, clarity, alignment)
   - Provide specific recommendations for each finding

3. **Review Each Document**
   - Assess completeness of project discovery
   - Validate requirements coverage and traceability
   - Evaluate architecture alignment with requirements

4. **Check Cross-Document Consistency**
   - Verify objectives trace through requirements to architecture
   - Check for contradictions or gaps
   - Ensure constraints are addressed

5. **Make Recommendation**
   - Decide on action (proceed, revise, escalate, reject)
   - Provide rationale for decision
   - List next steps if proceeding
   - Identify any blockers

## Review Criteria

- **Completeness**: All required sections populated with meaningful content
- **Consistency**: No contradictions between documents
- **Feasibility**: Architecture can satisfy requirements within constraints
- **Clarity**: Content is clear and unambiguous
- **Alignment**: All artifacts align with stated objectives

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- overall_assessment: Object with status, confidence_score, summary
- findings: Array with id, severity, category, source_document, description, recommendation
- document_reviews: Array with document_type, status, completeness_score, notes
- cross_document_issues: Array with issue, affected_documents, resolution
- recommendation: Object with action, rationale, next_steps, blockers

Be thorough but constructive. Focus on actionable feedback.
