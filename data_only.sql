Everything that follows — epics, architecture, and stories — should trace back to what’s captured here. If Product Discovery is weak or missing, downstream documents will drift or contradict each other.	architecture	compass	{"type": "object", "required": ["project_name", "preliminary_summary"], "properties": {"unknowns": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "mvp_guardrails": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}, "blocking_questions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}, "preliminary_summary": {"type": "string"}, "early_decision_points": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}, "architectural_directions": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object"}}}}	1.0	architect	project_discovery	\N	project_discovery	[]	[]	{}	project	10	t	1.0	2025-12-17 11:38:28.951547-05	2025-12-17 11:38:28.951547-05	\N	\N	f	\N

Each epic represents a meaningful outcome that must exist for the product to succeed, without prescribing implementation details.\n\nThis document translates discovery into structure. It sets scope boundaries, highlights dependencies, and makes explicit what is in and out of the MVP. Architecture uses the Epic Backlog as its primary input.

It ensures that stories are feasible, consistent, and aligned with system constraints.

03f295b8-e717-43cc-bfd3-367fd02a256e	WARMPULS	WarmPulse	WarmPulse Distributed Keep-Alive System — Synopsis\n\nWarmPulse is a distributed keep-alive and observability mechanism designed to prevent cold starts while simultaneously measuring real-world service readiness.\n\nInstead of a traditional periodic health check, WarmPulse propagates a lightweight “pulse” through the actual dependency graph of a system—API gateways, Lambdas, containers, queues, databases, and downstream services—using the same execution paths as real traffic.\n\nEach pulse serves two purposes at once:\n    1.    Prevention:\nIt keeps critical services warm, avoiding cold starts and first-request latency spikes in serverless and on-demand infrastructure.\n    2.    Measurement:\nIt records end-to-end idle latency, revealing how long each component takes to transition from idle to ready under realistic conditions.\n\nKey characteristics:\n    •    Pulses are intentionally minimal and non-mutating.\n    •    Propagation follows real dependency edges, not synthetic health endpoints.\n    •    Latency is captured at each hop and correlated into a single trace.\n    •    Results form a continuously updated “cold-start risk map” of the system.\n\nWarmPulse turns keep-alive traffic from a blunt instrument into a diagnostic signal. Instead of guessing where cold starts hurt, teams can see exactly which components decay under inactivity, how fast they recover, and where targeted warming—or architectural change—actually matters.\n\nIn short:\nWarmPulse keeps systems awake and tells you how deeply they were asleep.	active	2025-12-16 22:14:10.509062-05	2025-12-18 20:59:58.477909-05	\N	{}	zap
