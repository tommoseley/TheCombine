Next Document: Project Discovery Document

Purpose of This Document:
To explore solution space, validate assumptions, identify risks, and define scope and constraints - without committing to architecture or implementation.

What This Document Assumes Is Already True:

* The problem statement is correct
* The project intent is valid
* The project type (greenfield, enhancement, etc.) is correct

This Clarification Step Exists To Prevent:

* Starting discovery under the wrong framing (e.g., personal vs commercial, internal vs external)
* Discovering too late that the scope category is incorrect
* Producing a discovery document that answers the wrong questions

Questions Asked Here Must:

* Affect how discovery is run
* Change what discovery needs to explore
* Or determine whether discovery should proceed as planned
