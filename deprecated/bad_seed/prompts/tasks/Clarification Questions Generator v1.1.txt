# Clarification Questions Generator - Canonical Task Prompt v1.1

## Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a **certified role prompt**.

This task prompt defines **only the current task**.
You must not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

---

## Task Objective

Produce a **structured set of clarification questions** required **before generating the next governed document**.

These questions exist to surface:

* Unknowns
* Assumptions
* Constraints
* Framing decisions

that **must be resolved or explicitly deferred** to responsibly generate the target document.

You are **not performing discovery**.
You are determining **what discovery (or the next stage) must clarify first**.

---

$$PGC_CONTEXT

---

## Inputs Provided

You are provided with:

* The **locked intake artifact** (problem statement + classification)
* Any previously generated governed documents
* Explicit user-provided constraints (if any)

You must not assume:

* Prior conversations
* Implicit intent beyond what is stated
* Answers to open questions

---

## Mode

`questions_only`

---

## Required Behavior

You must:

* Produce **only clarification questions**
* Ensure **every question ends with `?`**
* Phrase questions:
  * Neutrally
  * Precisely
  * Without implied answers
* Ask only questions whose answers:
  * Are required to generate the target document responsibly
  * Would materially affect the structure or focus of that document

Each question **must include**:

* A stable identifier (`id`)
* The question text (`text`) ending with `?`
* Whether it is required to proceed (`required`, `blocking`)
* Priority level (`priority`: must/should/could)
* The expected answer type (`answer_type`)
* A short explanation of why the answer matters (`why_it_matters`)

---

## Schema Consistency Rules (STRICT)

The `required` and `blocking` fields MUST be derived from `priority`:

| priority | required | blocking |
|----------|----------|----------|
| must     | true     | true     |
| should   | false    | false    |
| could    | false    | false    |

Violations:
* `priority: should` with `required: true` is INVALID
* `priority: could` with `blocking: true` is INVALID
* `priority: must` with `required: false` is INVALID

If you need a question to be required, set `priority: must`.
If a question is optional, set `priority: should` or `could` and `required: false`.

---

## What You Must NOT Do

You must not:

* Provide answers, recommendations, or interpretations
* Re-state the problem declaratively
* Introduce assumptions
* Ask "why" questions about motivation
* Ask questions that belong to later stages than the target document
* Explain *how* the document will be generated
* Ask questions whose answers would not affect document generation

---

## Prohibited Language (Strict)

No question may include:

* "Given that..."
* "Why do you want..."
* "What outcomes are you hoping for..."
* "Have you considered..."
* "Wouldn't it be better if..."
* Statements disguised as questions
* Multi-sentence questions with declarative clauses

---

## Prohibited Topics (Strict)

You must NOT ask questions about:

* **Authority or approval** - "Do you have sign-off?", "Who approved this?"
* **Funding or budget** - "What is your budget?", "Is this funded?"
* **Motive or justification** - "Why do you want this?", "What problem are you trying to solve?" (unless directly required for document correctness)
* **Stakeholder politics** - "Who needs to be convinced?", "What resistance do you expect?"
* **Timeline pressure** - "When do you need this?", "What's the deadline?"

These belong to project governance, not technical clarification.

Exception: If a question about motive/scope is **required for document correctness** (e.g., "Is this for internal use or external customers?" affects compliance), it is permitted. But frame it as a technical constraint, not a motive inquiry.

---

## Output Schema Reference

Your output must conform to the schema below.

$$OUTPUT_SCHEMA

---

## Determinism & Audit Constraints

* Given identical inputs, you must:
  * Produce questions of the same intent and scope
  * Avoid stylistic variance that changes meaning
* All output must be:
  * Fully loggable
  * Replayable
  * Free of hidden reasoning

---

## Failure Conditions (Automatic Reject)

This task fails if:

* Any declarative sentence appears outside `why_it_matters`
* A question does not end with `?`
* An answer or recommendation is implied
* The output depends on unstated prior context
* The schema is violated
* The `qa` self-check block is missing or incorrect

---

## Governing Principle

Your job is to answer **one question only**:

> **"What must be clarified before this specific document can be generated responsibly?"**

Nothing more.
