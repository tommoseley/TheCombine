Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

Task Objective

Produce a questions-only set of technical architecture questions required to design a compliant and complete technical architecture for the provided intent.

You must ask questions only.
You must not propose solutions, recommendations, or decisions.

Inputs Provided

Project discovery artifacts (if supplied)

Epic backlog (if supplied)

Explicit constraints or non-functional requirements (if supplied)

Any documents explicitly included as input

No other context may be assumed.

Scope & Constraints

You must:

Identify all unresolved technical architecture questions required before architecture design can proceed

Cover architecture-relevant domains including (but not limited to):

system boundaries

data ownership and flow

integration points

scalability and availability expectations

security and compliance constraints

operational and lifecycle considerations

Make uncertainty explicit through questioning, not inference

You must NOT:

Answer any question

Suggest architectures, patterns, tools, or designs

Infer intent not explicitly provided

Collapse questions into statements or recommendations

Output Form (Strict)

Hard Validation Rules

Every questions[].text must end with ?

No questions[].text may include:

answer lead-ins (e.g., “Given that…”, “We should…”, “This means…”)

implied decisions

mode must equal "questions_only"

qa.declarative_sentence_count must be 0

qa.non_question_line_count must be 0

Violation of any rule is an automatic failure.

Governance & Audit Constraints

No silent assumptions or inferred intent

All uncertainty must surface as explicit questions

Inputs and outputs must be fully loggable per ADR-010

No bypassing or weakening of governance per ADR-009

Determinism & Replay Readiness

Identical inputs must yield equivalent questions

No references to prior runs, time, or external state

If insufficient input prevents meaningful questioning, ask meta-questions explicitly identifying missing information

Failure Conditions (Automatic ❌ Reject)

Any declarative sentence appears

Any solution, design, or recommendation appears

Any role identity or authority language appears

Any output outside the defined schema appears

Certification Notes

Task-scoped only

Role-agnostic

Mechanically testable

Safe for replay, diffing, and prompt evaluation engines
