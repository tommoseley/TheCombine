Session Summary - January 5, 2026
Completed Work
Admin UI Enhancements
1. Unified Executions Page - Combined workflow executions and document builds with source filtering (All/Workflows/Documents)
2. Unified Costs Dashboard - Combined cost tracking with stacked bar chart showing workflow vs document costs
3. Date Range Filtering - Added date pickers to Executions page with proper "from/to" semantics (same date = full day)
4. Execution Details Page - Created detailed view for document builds showing:
   * Project info, role, model, prompt
   * Timing, tokens, cost
   * Inputs/outputs with expandable content
   * Errors with severity badges
5. Dashboard Links - "Doc Builds Today" stat links to filtered executions
6. Timezone Support - All dates display in Eastern Time (converted from UTC storage)
Public UI Enhancements
1. Document Header Partial - Created _document_header.html for consistent headers across all document types
2. Prepared Date - All documents now show "Prepared: [date/time]" under the description
3. localtime Filter - Added Jinja2 filter for UTC→local timezone conversion
Navigation Fixes
* Fixed HTMX partial responses causing nested layouts
* Back button now works correctly with full page reload
Tests
* 940 tests passing
Pending: ADR-011 Document Ownership
Reviewed ADR-011-Part-2 but did not implement. Key gaps:
* parent_document_id column not added
* No cycle detection, scope validation, or deletion guards
* No UI for Epic→Story ownership traversal
This is significant work for a future session.
Good session! The admin UI is now much more functional for tracking document builds and costs.
