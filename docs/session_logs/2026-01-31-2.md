# Session Summary - 2026-01-31-2

## Scope
- React SPA project management features (rename, archive, delete)
- Archive filter in project list sidebar

## Decisions Made
- SSE preferred over polling for real-time updates
- Archive required before delete (project governance)
- After archive/delete, select next project in sorted visual order
- Scroll selected project into view (could not preserve scroll position)
- Archive button toggles to unarchive when project is archived (with slash through icon)
- Delete button disabled (faded) until project is archived

## Implemented
- `PATCH /api/v1/projects/{id}` - Update project name/description/icon
- `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/archive` - Archive project
- `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/unarchive` - Restore archived project
- `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}` - Soft delete project
- API client methods: updateProject, archiveProject, unarchiveProject, deleteProject
- Floor.jsx: Project Info block with inline name editing, archive toggle, delete button
- Floor.jsx: Delete confirmation modal
- ProjectTree.jsx: Archive filter toggle in header
- ProjectTree.jsx: Archive icon on archived projects
- App.jsx: Project management handlers with sorted selection logic
- useProjects.js: includeArchived option
- transformers.js: isArchived field extraction
- App logo branding: favicon (logo-256.png), sidebar header, loading screens
- Logo assets: logo-light.png, logo-dark.png, logo-256.png in spa/public/
