# Session Summary - 2026-02-04 (Session 2)

## Scope
- Commit and push large uncommitted changeset from prior session
- Formalize system ontology: primitives, composites, and configuration taxonomy
- Assess WS-044 work statement status
- Draft WS-045 implementation work statement

## Decisions Made
- System ontology formalized as ADR-045 (Accepted): two primitives (Prompt Fragment, Schema), one ontological term (Interaction Pass), four composites (Role, Task, DCW, POW)
- Prompt Fragments shape behavior; Schemas define acceptability; Interaction Passes bind and execute both
- Interaction Pass is vocabulary, not a configurable artifact -- it names what a DCW node is, not something you CRUD
- Outcome Artifacts are produced, not configured -- never live in combine-config/
- Schemas are reusable across DCWs and should be extracted to standalone combine-config/schemas/
- DCW is synonymous with "Document Production Workflow"
- Admin Workbench left rail must be organized by abstraction level, not artifact type: Production Workflows > Building Blocks > Governance
- Tasks added as a Building Block alongside Roles, Schemas, Templates

## Open Threads
- WS-ADR-045-001 awaiting acceptance before execution
- WS-044-04 (DocDef & Sidecar Editor) not started
- WS-044-05 (Workflow & Production Mode Config) partially complete
- WS-044-10 Phase 4 (seed/ cleanup) not started
- Produces field dropdown for orchestration step editor still pending
- software_product_development definition.json still has role/task_prompt on steps (data cleanup needed)

## Known Risks / Drift Warnings
- ADR-045 and WS-ADR-045-001 not yet committed to Git
- Existing documentation uses varied terminology that must converge to ADR-045 vocabulary over time
- Schema extraction (WS-045 Phase 3) will require careful backward-compatible transition
