# Session Summary - 2026-02-06-3

## Scope
- WS-ADR-047-001 Phases 5-7: Frontend integration for Mechanical Operations (ADR-047)

## Decisions Made
- Mechanical operations displayed in Building Blocks tray with purple dot color
- Internal type selector (LLM/MECH/UI) added to task nodes in NodePropertiesPanel
- PGC Pass B supports both LLM and MECH internal types for clarification merge
- MechanicalOpEditor created as read-only viewer for operation details

## Implemented
- **Phase 5: Building Blocks Integration**
  - Added mechanical ops state and loading in AdminWorkbench
  - Added Mechanical Ops section to BuildingBlocksTray with type grouping
  - Wired selection handler for mechanical operations

- **Phase 6: Node Properties Panel for MECH**
  - Added INTERNAL_TYPES constant (LLM, MECH, UI)
  - Added internal_type selector for task nodes
  - Added MECH config UI with operation dropdown and info preview
  - Added UI config for operator entry nodes (renders, captures)
  - Updated PGC Pass B to support both LLM and MECH with internal_type toggle
  - Passed mechanical ops through component chain: AdminWorkbench → PromptEditor → WorkflowEditorContent → NodePropertiesPanel

- **MechanicalOpEditor**
  - Created new editor component for viewing mechanical operation details
  - Shows operation info (ID, name, description, type, version)
  - Shows type info (inputs, outputs, category, icon)
  - Shows configuration JSON preview
  - Shows metadata (created date, author, tags)
  - Read-only with note to edit YAML files directly
