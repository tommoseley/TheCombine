# Session Summary - 2026-02-18

## Scope
- Design discussion: Sow/Cultivate/Harvest lifecycle, MCP connector vision, Claude Code integration, defect traceability
- Design discussion: Work organization model — replacing Agile hierarchy with IP ? WP ? WS
- ADR-050: Work Statement Verification Constitution (Mode A/B, tiered verification, test-first rule)
- ADR-051: Work Package as Runtime Primitive (replaces Epics/Features)
- ADR-052: Document Pipeline Integration for Work Packages and Work Statements
- WS-ADR-050-001: Tier 0 Verification Harness — executed by Claude Code
- WS-ADR-050-002: ADR-050 Protocol Prove-Out (HTMX admin removal) — executed by Claude Code
- WS-ADMIN-RECONCILE-001: Admin reconciliation — authored, in flight
- WS-ADMIN-EXEC-UI-001: Admin Executions SPA screen — authored, queued

## Decisions Made
- Work Statements are the atomic execution unit; Work Packages are the progress-tracked unit; Implementation Plans define the strategic graph
- Epics, Features, Stories, and Sprints are replaced by IP ? WP ? WS hierarchy
- Verification Mode A (mechanical) is default; Mode B (human gate) is a narrow, tracked exception with mechanization plan
- Test-First Rule: failing tests from intent must exist before implementation
- Tiered verification: Tier 0 (mandatory baseline) + Tier 1 (WS-specific postconditions)
- B metrics (B-rate, B-streak, B?A conversion) are factory health indicators
- Work Packages are runtime objects with state (PLANNED ? READY ? IN_PROGRESS ? AWAITING_GATE ? DONE), not just planning artifacts
- Governance artifacts are pinned at WP instantiation for replayability
- WS dynamic queue: WS are spawned into WP, not statically bound
- IPP/IPF schemas will evolve from epic_candidates[] to work_package_candidates[]
- TA may emit ADR candidates; ADRs remain the decision ledger (pinned in ADR-052 non-goals)
- Sow/Cultivate/Harvest lifecycle: external LLM for ideation, Combine for governance, Claude Code for execution
- "Send to Combine" clipboard prompt is sufficient for Sow?Cultivate handoff initially
- Project Discovery applies smell test (yes/no/are you sure) before pipeline proceeds

## Implemented
- ADR-050 written and accepted
- ADR-051 written and accepted
- ADR-052 written (draft, accept on merge)
- WS-ADR-050-001 written and accepted
- WS-ADR-050-002 written and accepted
- WS-ADMIN-RECONCILE-001 authored
- WS-ADMIN-EXEC-UI-001 scoped
- Tier 0 harness (ops/scripts/tier0.sh) built by Claude Code — 11 tests, Mode B enforcement, JSON output, CI guards
- HTMX admin removal executed under ADR-050 protocol by Claude Code — 50 files changed, 8099 lines deleted

## Commits / PRs
- Claude Code committed Tier 0 harness and HTMX admin removal (exact SHAs not captured in this session)

## Open Threads
- WS-ADMIN-RECONCILE-001 in flight with Claude Code
- WS-ADMIN-EXEC-UI-001 queued for Claude Code
- Project Logbook — Combine-managed projects need a productized equivalent of PROJECT_STATE.md
- TA emitting ADR candidates — pinned as future work in ADR-052
- MCP connector design — read-only document query layer as first step
- WS as Combine document type — needed before factory can author its own work
- Multi-LLM conversation tool for Sow phase — explored, no build needed now
- Clipboard "Send to Combine" prompt — not yet authored

## Known Risks / Drift Warnings
- HTMX admin removal left dangling menu item and removed active instrumentation (execution/cost tracking) — reconciliation WS in flight
- Existing IPP/IPF schemas, prompts, and epic-based documents will require migration when ADR-052 is implemented
- Claude Code expanded scope beyond WS-050-001 (harness hardening) — was directed by Tom, not autonomous drift, but validates need for strict WS boundaries in automated cycles
