# Session Summary - 2026-02-19

## Scope
- Execute WS-ONTOLOGY-001: Register `work_package` as first-class document type in the artifact store

## Decisions Made
- None (WS executed as authored — no ambiguity encountered)

## Implemented
- State machine module (`app/domain/services/work_package_state.py`): 5 states (PLANNED → READY → IN_PROGRESS → AWAITING_GATE → DONE), valid transitions, `InvalidWPTransitionError`
- Handler (`app/domain/handlers/work_package_handler.py`): extends `BaseDocumentHandler` with state enum validation, default rollup fields (ws_total, ws_done, mode_b_count), title extraction, render/render_summary
- Handler registration in `app/domain/handlers/registry.py`
- Seed registry entry in `seed/registry/document_types.py` with full JSON Schema (10 required fields, state enum, governance_pins object)
- 20 Tier 1 tests across 6 criteria (C1–C6) in `tests/tier1/handlers/test_work_package_handler.py`
