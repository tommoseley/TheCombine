# Session Summary - 2026-02-21

## Scope
- Strategic planning session: beta blocklist, WP/WS DCW work package authoring, ADR-053 finalization
- Claude Code: Do No Harm audit and amendment of WP-DCW-001 work statements
- Do No Harm audit requirement added to POL-WS-001, CLAUDE.md, ai.md

## Decisions Made
- ADR-053 accepted: Planning Before Architecture (Discovery -> IPP -> IPF -> TA -> WPs)
- WP-DCW-001 authored: 5 Work Statements for WP/WS DCWs, POW rewrite, Epic cleanup, seed migration
- Do No Harm audit added as mandatory pre-execution step in POL-WS-001 Section 6, CLAUDE.md, ai.md
- WS-OPS-001 authored: Transient LLM error recovery with honest gate outcomes
- Project Logbook logging policy: ADRs always, WP state transitions, WS acceptance -- not activity
- Logbook writes triggered by acceptance service, not by Claude Code during execution
- combine-config/ confirmed as canonical runtime source; seed/ is parity only
- Beta blocklist: WP-DCW-001 is the last structural work before v1

## Implemented
- POL-WS-001 updated: Do No Harm audit added to Section 6 as mandatory pre-execution step
- CLAUDE.md updated: Do No Harm audit added as item 1 in POL-WS-001 Bootstrap Requirements
- ai.md updated: Same Do No Harm audit addition (ready for Project Knowledge sync)
- ADR-053 written to docs/adr/ADR-053-Planning-Before-Architecture.md
- WS-SDP-001 written to docs/work-statements/WS-SDP-001.md
- WS-SDP-002 written to docs/work-statements/WS-SDP-002.md
- WP-DCW-001 written to docs/work-statements/WP-DCW-001.md
- WS-DCW-001 through WS-DCW-005 written to docs/work-statements/
- WS-OPS-001 written to docs/work-statements/WS-OPS-001.md
- WS-TIER0-SCOPE-001 written to docs/work-statements/WS-TIER0-SCOPE-001.md
- Claude Code amended WS-DCW-001, 002, 003, 005: allowed_paths updated to combine-config/ as primary, split-brain guard criteria added, procedure steps target combine-config paths

## Commits / PRs
- None from this session (all work is WS authoring and policy updates, not code execution)

## Open Threads
- WP-DCW-001 execution pending: Claude Code locked up after Do No Harm amendment pass, needs restart
- Claude Code amended WS-DCW-001/002/003/005 but did not begin execution of any WS
- WS-TIER0-SCOPE-001 execution pending
- Logbook schema reconciliation needed: ChatGPT proposed schemas need Do No Harm check against existing registered schemas in seed/registry/document_types.py
- Logbook entry growth model: append-only array in single document may not scale past hundreds of entries

## Known Risks / Drift Warnings
- Claude Code locked up mid-session -- restart required, verify WS file state before resuming execution
- WS amendments on disk may have partial writes -- verify all four amended files are consistent before proceeding
