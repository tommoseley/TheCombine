# Session Summary - 2026-02-24

## Scope
- Fix admin transcript viewer truncation (TranscriptBlock default expanded)
- Fix IPP rendering (work_package_candidates showing as bullet list instead of card-list)
- Rename implementation_plan_primary to primary_implementation_plan across codebase
- DB migration for document_types table (old name to new name, FK constraint workaround)
- WS-SKILLS-001: Decompose CLAUDE.md into 10 Claude Code Skills

## Decisions Made
- Rename doc_type_id to match combine-config directory name (primary_implementation_plan) rather than adding alias/redirect
- Split session changes into 3 topical commits (IPP rename, transcript fix, skills decomposition)

## Implemented
- TranscriptBlock in ExecutionDetail.jsx defaults to expanded (was collapsed at 200px)
- Renamed implementation_plan_primary to primary_implementation_plan in: handler, registry, workflow definitions, active_releases, 3 test files
- DB migration on DEV: INSERT clone row with new name, UPDATE children FK references, DELETE old row
- WS-SKILLS-001 executed: 10 skills created in .claude/skills/, CLAUDE.md slimmed from 27,178 to 13,754 chars
- 117 verification tests for WS-SKILLS-001 (all 16 criteria covered)
- Skills: ws-execution, autonomous-bug-fix, subagent-dispatch, metrics-reporting, session-management, config-governance, ia-validation, ia-golden-tests, tier0-verification, combine-governance
- .claude/skills/README.md catalog

## Commits / PRs
- 7a6626f fix: Rename implementation_plan_primary to primary_implementation_plan everywhere
- da4c868 fix: Default transcript blocks to expanded in admin execution detail
- 68b8f12 feat: Decompose CLAUDE.md into 10 Claude Code Skills (WS-SKILLS-001)
- cfe5b19 chore: Add Claude Code settings.json
- All pushed to origin/main

## Open Threads
- DB migration for TEST environment (only DEV was updated)
- Alembic migration 20260223_001 still pending on DEV/TEST RDS
- IPP task prompt field names still don't match IPP schema
- React test harness needed to retire Mode B debt

## Known Risks / Drift Warnings
- document_types table on TEST RDS still has old name (implementation_plan_primary)
- CLAUDE.md is now loaded by Project Knowledge but skills are on filesystem — if Project Knowledge cache is stale, agent may see old CLAUDE.md with moved sections
