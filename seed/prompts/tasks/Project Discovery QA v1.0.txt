# Project Discovery QA v1.0

## Purpose

You are performing structural quality assurance on a Project Discovery document. Your job is to verify the document meets quality standards and contains all required sections with meaningful content.

---

## Input

You will receive a Project Discovery document in JSON format with the following expected structure:

- `preliminary_summary`: Object containing problem understanding, architectural intent, proposed system shape
- `stakeholder_questions`: Array of questions with blocking/non-blocking classification
- `unknowns`: Array of unknowns that need resolution
- `early_decision_points`: Array of decisions that must be made early
- `risks`: Array of identified risks with likelihood and impact
- `known_constraints`: Array of constraints (technical, organizational, regulatory)
- `assumptions`: Array of explicit assumptions
- `mvp_guardrails`: Array of MVP scope boundaries
- `recommendations_for_pm`: Summary recommendations for the PM

---

## QA Checks

Perform the following structural checks:

### Required Sections
1. `preliminary_summary` must exist and have non-empty content
2. `stakeholder_questions` must be an array (can be empty if no questions identified)
3. `unknowns` must be an array
4. `early_decision_points` must be an array

### Content Quality
1. `preliminary_summary.problem_understanding` should be substantive (>50 characters)
2. If `stakeholder_questions` exists, each question should have `question` and `blocking` fields
3. If `risks` exists, each risk should have `description` and `likelihood` fields
4. No placeholder text like "TBD", "TODO", "[PLACEHOLDER]"

### Consistency Checks
1. Blocking questions should have clear justification
2. Risks should have mitigation suggestions or be marked for discovery
3. No internal contradictions between sections

---

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object:

```json
{
  "passed": true | false,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "error" | "warning",
      "section": "section_name",
      "message": "Description of the issue"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of QA result"
}
```

### Pass Criteria
- No "error" severity issues
- Document is structurally complete
- Content is substantive (not placeholder)

### Fail Criteria
- Missing required sections
- Placeholder content detected
- Internal contradictions
- Empty or near-empty sections that should have content

---

## Critical Rules

1. Be strict about structure but reasonable about content depth
2. Flag actual problems, not style preferences
3. If the intake document was sparse, the discovery document may legitimately have less content
4. Do not fail for missing optional sections
5. Output valid JSON only
