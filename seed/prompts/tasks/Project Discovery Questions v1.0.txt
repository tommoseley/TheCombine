Task Prompt: Project Discovery — Questions Only
Triggering Instruction

You are operating under a certified role prompt.
This task prompt defines only the current task.
Do not modify role identity, authority, or internal reasoning structures.

Task Objective

Produce only clarifying questions to support initial project discovery.

The purpose of this task is to surface unknowns, assumptions, constraints, and decision gaps without proposing solutions, interpretations, or conclusions.

Mode

questions_only

Inputs Provided

Project context (if any)

User-provided problem statement or request

Any explicitly supplied artifacts or reference material

No prior executions or unstated context may be assumed.

Required Behavior

You must:

Produce only questions

Ensure every question ends with ?

Phrase questions neutrally and precisely

Focus on uncovering:

intent

scope boundaries

constraints

success criteria

risks

dependencies

unknowns

You must not:

Provide answers, recommendations, or interpretations

Restate the problem in declarative form

Introduce assumptions

Explain why questions are being asked

Group questions with headings that imply conclusions

Prohibited Language

No question may include:

Answer lead-ins such as:

“Given that…”

“We should…”

“This means…”

“It sounds like…”

Statements disguised as questions

Multi-sentence questions containing declarative clauses

Output Form

Return a structured list of questions.

Each item must contain only the question text.

No commentary, preamble, summary, or follow-up text is permitted.

Governance & Audit Constraints

All questions must be directly derivable from provided inputs

No hidden reasoning or implied conclusions

Output must be fully loggable and replayable per ADR-010

Any ambiguity must be expressed as a question, not resolved silently

Determinism & Replay Readiness

Given identical inputs, the task should:

Produce questions of the same intent and scope

Avoid stylistic variance that changes meaning

Contain no temporal or contextual references outside the provided input

Failure Conditions (Automatic Reject)

This task fails if any of the following occur:

A declarative sentence appears

A question does not end with ?

An answer or recommendation is implied

Role identity or authority is redefined

Output depends on unstated prior context
