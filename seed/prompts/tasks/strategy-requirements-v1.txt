# Requirements Analysis Task

Based on the Project Discovery document, create a detailed requirements specification.

## Instructions

1. **Derive Functional Requirements**
   - Transform each objective into specific functional requirements
   - Use MoSCoW prioritization (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
   - Include clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
   - Trace each requirement back to its source objective

2. **Define Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Address performance, security, scalability, reliability
   - Include measurable metrics where possible
   - Consider usability and maintainability

3. **Create User Stories**
   - Write stories in "As a... I want... So that..." format
   - Include acceptance criteria
   - Estimate complexity where appropriate

4. **Identify Data Requirements**
   - List key data entities
   - Define important attributes
   - Note relationships between entities

5. **Document Integration Requirements**
   - Identify external systems that must integrate
   - Specify integration types and protocols

## Output Format

Respond with a JSON object containing:
- functional_requirements: Array with id, title, description, priority, acceptance_criteria, dependencies, source_objective
- non_functional_requirements: Array with id, category, description, metric, target_value
- user_stories: Array with id, as_a, i_want, so_that, acceptance_criteria, story_points
- data_requirements: Array with entity, attributes, relationships
- integration_requirements: Array with system, type, description

Ensure traceability from requirements to discovery objectives.
