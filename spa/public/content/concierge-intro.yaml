title: What the Concierge Does

paragraphs:
  - Before we generate plans, documents, or workflows, we start with a short intake step.
  - The Concierge's job is to understand what kind of work you're starting and what path makes the most sense. It does this by reading your description, identifying the type of project, and preparing the right workflow to continue.
  - This step prevents wasted effort, avoids asking the wrong questions later, and ensures that anything we generate is grounded in your actual intent.
  - You'll have a chance to review and correct the classification before anything proceeds.

call_to_action: When you're ready, describe what you want to accomplish.
